### Scenarios


You will face 4 shocks over the course of the game.
	
Three of shocks will be randomly generated from the following list:

1.	A recession, resulting in a reduction of GDP from anywhere between 0 and 10%
2.	Your budget will be cut from anywhere between 0 and 10%
3.	A possible (25%) refugee crisis, in which your Gini coefficient resets to 0.3 (though if your Gini coefficient is higher than 0.3 it will remain unchanged)
4.	Inflation causes an one-off increase in the cost of the policy, from anywhere between 10% and 50%
	
The final shock will be revealed when you get to it.
	
The timing of the policies is just as important as the policies themselves.
All policies will have an effect on GDP/inequality in your chosen year, while some will have a longer lasting effect as well. You should bear this in mind.
	
You will be scored by:

1. how your GDP ranking compares with other teams; the higher the better
2. how your Gini coefficient compares with other teams; the lower the better
3. any remaining budget; a positive budget will increase your score, a negative budget reduces it
